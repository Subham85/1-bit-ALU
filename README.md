# Mixed Signal SoC design Marathon using eSim & SKY130

# 1-bit ALU 

## Abstract
A basic design of a 1-bit ALU has been proposed in
this report. The circuit is capable of perfoming
logical and arithmetic operations. The design
comprises of both digital and analog blocks. It is
intended for a mixed-signal application.
